Sorting within a range

rangesort.c

Takes in one of these generated files and sorts it based on the 4-byte key (the remainder of the record should of course be kept with the same key). Keys which fall outside of lowvalue and highvalue should be discarded (and not written to the output file). The output is written to the specified output file.
