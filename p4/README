Linux:
For this part of the project, everything was changed through the server.c file.
4 functions besides the main was created in order to build the producer-consumer relationship for the web server. 
These 4 functions were mostly taken/implemented as it was from the textbook with a slight tweak to it. 
Other than that, the work that was needed to be done was to :
      accept new arguments for the thread and buffer size, 
      initializing locks and conditional variables, 
      and knowing where to place the thread create and thread join


xv6: 
- Clone { 
  Basically copied the fork() code. 
  Took out everything that was unecessary.
  Changed parts like the page directory allocation that wouldn't work with threads.
  Added the stack setup
}

- Join {
  Copied the wait() code.
  Again, took out everything unecessary and changed parts that wouldn't work.
  Had to differentiate between what would look like a child process and a thread when looking for Zombies
  Once found, some things needed to be removed and some didn't from the wait code - took a few lines out
}

- Library {
  Thread_create/join:
    These were as simple as bounds checking, error checking, and then properly calling the system calls
  Locks:
    This code was practically word for word already in the xv6 code. Mostly just copy/paste
}
